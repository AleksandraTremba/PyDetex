API
===

Although PyDetex is intended to be used through its GUI, the module contains several
practical methods to detect LaTex commands, environments, equations, among others.
The GUI only uses the pipelines to transform the tex code to plain text. On the
other hand, the pipelines use parsers.

You can check for the parsers, pipelines, and utilâ€™s methods to create your
pipelines in the left menu!
