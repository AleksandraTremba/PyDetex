Park and Kwon [1] recognized the main walls of apartments using the auxiliary dimension line, where windows can be retrieved as a subproduct. Feltes et al.'s [2] work is capable of finding the object's corners in wall-line drawing images by filtering out unnecessary points without changing the overall structure, especially those that appeared through over-segmentation on diagonal lines; also, a wall-gap filling is possible while performing a heuristic criterion. Tang et al. [3] automatically generated vector drawings by applying various filters, such as gradient, length, gap-filling, line-merging, and connectivity under several millimeter sizes, assuming walls are represented by parallel lines in both vertical and horizontal axis. Pan et al. [4] detected walls and windows considering empirical rules regarding their pixel layouts, where the user must adjust its thresholds. The bearing wall corresponded to black areas, non-bearing walls to parallel, unfilled rectangles, and windows are composed of three to four closer parallel lines. De [5] also assumed that only walls are illustrated as thick black lines in a floor plan layout. Thus, thick and thin lines can be distinguished using a morphological transformation; thick lines can be considered walls, whereas arc lines represent doors. On the other hand, in an effort to overcome the lack of a standard notation, de las Heras et al. [6] presented an unsupervised wall segmentation using the assumption of them being a repetitive element, rectangular, placed in orthogonal directions, filled with the same pattern and naturally distributed across the plan. Although assumptions might work over a set, they do not consider semantical relationships or work for multiple plan styles.
